		<h4>Theme Downloads</h4>
		<p>Once you make payment you will be directed to a page where you can download your purchase and print a receipt. You will also be sent an email with a link to the download page. You have 24 hours from the point of payment in which to download your purchase.</p>
		
		<h4>Sample Presentations</h4>
		<p>The presentations shown on the individual theme pages are only samples of what can be achieved using Keynote and our custom themes. They are not included with any purchase. We are unable to provide them to any customers because many of the images are not licensed for resale.</p>
		
		<h4>iPad, iPhone and iOS</h4>
		<p>Keynote for iOS does not easily support custom themes. You can put our themes on an iOS device by creating a presentation on your Mac and saving it to iCloud. Then open the presentation on your iOS device (iPad or iPhone). However, the iOS version of Keynote is limited compared to it's Macintosh counterpart. Our themes were designed for the Mac.</p>
