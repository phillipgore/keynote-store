		<h4>Keynote 6.0</h4>
		<p>The themes we currently have for sale have been updated for Keynote 6.0. We do not support and have no plans to update any of our old themes. If one of our old themes is mission critical to you be sure to keep Keynote â€™09 on your system so you can use it until you are able to recreate your presentation in Keynote 6.0.</p>
		<h4>Keynote for iOS</h4>
		<p>All of our current themes will work on your iPad or iPhone. Simply create a presentation on your Mac. Then save it to iCloud. The presentation along with the theme will be available in Keynote on your iOS devices.</p>
		<h4>Secure Checkout</h4>
		<p>Our entire site is secured using encryption with a digital certificate to keep your information private as it's sent to or from keynotestore.com including every step of the payment process.</p>
